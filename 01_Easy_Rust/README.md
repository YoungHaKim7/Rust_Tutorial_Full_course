# ‘Rust is inspired by a multitude of languages, 

- the notable ones being Cyclone (a safe dialect of C language) for its ideas on region-based memory management techniques; C++ for its RAII principle, and Haskell for its type system, error handling types, and typeclasses.
RAII stands for Resource Acquisition Is Initialization, a paradigm suggesting that resources must be acquired during the initialization of an object and must be released when their destructors are called or when they are deallocated.’
