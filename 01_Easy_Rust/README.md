# ‘Rust is inspired by a multitude of languages, 

- the notable ones being Cyclone (a safe dialect of C language) for its ideas on region-based memory management techniques; C++ for its RAII principle, and Haskell for its type system, error handling types, and typeclasses.
RAII stands for Resource Acquisition Is Initialization, a paradigm suggesting that resources must be acquired during the initialization of an object and must be released when their destructors are called or when they are deallocated.’

- ‘Through lifetimes, the compiler can track places in code where a reference is safe to use, reporting an error at compile time if it's illegal. To achieve this, <em><strong>Rust runs a borrow/reference checking algorithm by using these lifetime tags on references to ensure </em></strong>that you can never access a memory address that has been freed. It also does this so that you cannot free any pointer while it is being used by some other variable. We will go into the details of this in Chapter 5, Memory management and Safety.’
