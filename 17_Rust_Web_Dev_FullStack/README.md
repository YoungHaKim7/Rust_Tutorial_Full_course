    - Introduction
Wasmtime is a Bytecode Alliance project that is a standalone wasm-only optimizing runtime for WebAssembly and WASI. It runs WebAssembly code outside of the Web, and can be used both as a command-line utility or as a library embedded in a larger application.

Wasmtime strives to be a highly configurable and embeddable runtime to run on any scale of application. Many features are still under development so if you have a question don't hesitate to file an issue.

This guide is intended to serve a number of purposes and within you'll find:

How to create simple wasm modules
How to use Wasmtime from a number of languages
How to install and use the wasmtime CLI
Information about stability and security in Wasmtime.
... and more! The source for this guide lives on GitHub and contributions are welcome!
