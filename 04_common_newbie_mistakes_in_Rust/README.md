# Common Mistakes with Rust Async

- At Qovery, we start to have our fair share of Async Rust and to say the least it is not without caveats. Letâ€™s be honest, Async Rust is hard. It has many more rough edges than Sync Rust and requires a different mindset, but it solves a problem space well, that is hard to tackle otherwise. It allows safer network concurrency than C++ Boost.Asio and I would start this post by giving a big thanks to the Tokio team & ecosystem for the amazing work they provide to the community.
