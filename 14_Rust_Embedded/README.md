# Embedded GUI Rust 

- Slint: Are we GUI ye?

  - Slint is a toolkit to efficiently develop fluid graphical user interfaces for any display: embedded devices and desktop applications. We support multiple programming languages, such as Rust, C++ or JavaScript.

# Appendix A: Glossary

https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/embedded-book/appendix/glossary.html

- The embedded ecosystem is full of different protocols, hardware components and vendor-specific things that use their own terms and abbreviations. This Glossary attempts to list them with pointers for understanding them better.

- BSP

  - A Board Support Crate provides a high level interface configured for a specific board. It usually depends on a HAL crate. There is a more detailed description on the memory-mapped registers page or for a broader overview see this video.

- FPU

  - Floating-point Unit. A 'math processor' running only operations on fl

- HAL
  A Hardware Abstraction Layer crate provides a developer friendly interface to a microcontroller's features and peripherals. It is usually implemented on top of a Peripheral Access Crate (PAC). It may also implement traits from the embedded-hal crate. There is a more detailed description on the memory-mapped registers page or for a broader overview see this video.

- I2C

  - Sometimes referred to as I²C or Inter-IC. It is a protocol meant for hardware communication within a single integrated circuit. See here for more details
  - https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/embedded-book/appendix/glossary.html

- PAC

  - A Peripheral Access Crate provides access to a microcontroller's peripherals. It is one of the lower level crates and is usually generated directly from the provided SVD, often using svd2rust. The Hardware Abstraction Layer would usually depend on this crate. There is a more detailed description on the memory-mapped registers page or for a broader overview see this video.

- SPI

  - Serial Peripheral Interface. See here for more information.

- SVD

  - System View Description is an XML file format used to describe the programmers view of a microcontroller device. You can read more about it on the ARM CMSIS documentation site.

- UART

  - Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter. See here for more information.

- USART
  - Universal synchronous and asynchronous receiver-transmitter. See here for more information.
